And Bhima thereupon represented unto him the intentions of king Yudhishthira. And Bhima dwelt there, O king, for thirty nights, duly entertained by Sisupala. And after this he set out from Chedi with his troops and vehicles."

And the exalted one then subjugated the country of Gopalakaksha and the northern Kosalas and also the king of Mallas.

And that bull of Bharata race brought under control in this way diverse countries.
