A hundred dynasties of kings have become unable to oppose Jarasandha. He, therefore,   p. 37   may be regarded to be an emperor for his strength. Kings that are wearers of jewels worship Jarasandha (with presents of jewels). But, wicked from his childhood, he is scarcely satisfied with such worship.
